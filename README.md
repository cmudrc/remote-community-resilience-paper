### "Agent-Based Modeling for the Evaluation of Community Resilience In Silico"

_Paper submitted to [Engineering Reports](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/25778196)_

## Overview

This repository contains all code, data links, and analysis scripts used in the paper "Agent-Based Modeling for the Evaluation of Community Resilience In Silico" submitted to [Engineering Reports](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/25778196). The project is structured to allow users to run full simulations, explore existing results, and reproduce the analysis presented in the paper.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10 or higher
* Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Full Simulations

* To run the main simulation suite, run `main/main.py`
```
cd main
python main.py
```
* Results will be saved under `main/result/<scenario_name>/`.
* Each folder name corresponds to a unique scenario.
* Scenario details (parameters, seeds, etc.) are listed in `main/result/setups.csv`.

## Accessing Results

* __Local:__ After running `main/main.py`, inspect the `main/result/` directory.
* __Remote:__ Precomputed results are hosted on Hugging Face: 
[https://huggingface.co/datasets/cmudrc/incose-paper-data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cmudrc/incose-paper-data)

## Analysis

All post-processing and figure-generation scripts live in the `analysis/` folder. Each subfolder in `analysis/` corresponds to a specific analysis pipeline.

Scripts are designed to:

1. Look for local results in `main/result/`.
2. If unavailable, fetch data from the Hugging Face repository automatically.

## Tests

Two lightweight test suites are provided to verify functionality before running full simulations:

* __single-run:__ runs one scenario end-to-end (fast sanity check)
* __multi-run:__ runs multiple scenarios in parallel on a smaller scale

## Assets

Supplementary figures and assets (e.g., diagrams, raw images) are stored in `assets/`.
